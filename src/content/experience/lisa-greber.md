Built a client-facing online shop using the Shopify framework, implementing product catalogs, payment integration, and responsive design. Coordinated with the client to ensure business requirements were accurately reflected, and iterated on the user interface to improve clarity and usability. This experience strengthened my practical understanding of user-facing product development and how design and functionality decisions aﬀect the end-user experience.
