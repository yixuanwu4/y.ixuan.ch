I designed and built the official website for Quassel as a project-based frontend developer. Using Astro, a component-based framework, I created a fast, responsive, and accessible site that clearly presents the software's key functionality and value. The website was built with integrated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript inside Astro components. I collaborated closely with the team to understand the needs and translated them into a clean, modern UI.
