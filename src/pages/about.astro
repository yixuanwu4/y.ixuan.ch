    <p>
        Hi, I'm Yixuan. Born in China 🇨🇳, I've lived and studied in the UK 🇬🇧 and Germany 🇩🇪, and now I'm based in Zurich, Switzerland 🇨🇭. I'm passionate about technology—from Natural Language Processing to web development and 3D modeling. I've taught myself tools like Blender, Astro, and Three.js, and I'm always excited to learn more. <br><br>

        When I'm not coding, I love traveling 🛥️, cycling 🚴🏻‍♀️, playing badminton 🏸, and catching Pokémons :P I enjoy meeting new people, exploring new places, and taking on challenges that push me to grow. For me, life's all about turning “I can't” into “I did.” ✨ <br><br>

        Let's connect and create something amazing together!
