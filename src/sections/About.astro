  <p>
    As a developer passionate about crafting visually appealing and user-friendly web experiences, I enjoy the full creative process - from designing intuitive UI/UX to bringing those designs to life with clean, functional code.

    My background in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning has equipped me with a strong analytical foundation. Over time, I discovered that my true interest lies in software development and front-end engineering, which led me to pursue a freelance career where I can focus on building engaging digital products.

    Having grown up in China, I pursued further studies in the UK and Germany, experiences which have shaped my professional approach and personal worldview. I now live and work in Zurich, Switzerland, where I draw inspiration from the multicultural environment.

    When I'm not coding, you'll find me sketching, playing the piano, keeping active by playing various sports or catching Pokémon all around the world :)
